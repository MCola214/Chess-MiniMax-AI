# Chess-MiniMax-AI

Using React, Node.js, express, and MongoDB, I have created an AI to play chess by implementing game tree minimax search with alpha-beta pruning.

To set up the environment, run the script `npm run setup`.

To create a build for the front-end and run the server, use the script `npm run build-run`.

To only start the server, use the script `npm run start` or `npm start`.
